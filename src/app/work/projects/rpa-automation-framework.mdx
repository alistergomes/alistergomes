## Overview

At Novigo Solutions, I spearheaded the design and implementation of scalable RPA (Robotic Process Automation) solutions. My focus was on creating robust automation frameworks that could handle complex business processes with minimal manual intervention.

## Key Achievements

- **Enhanced Efficiency**: Developed frameworks incorporating UiPath's advanced scraping and in-built activities, achieving a **50% increase** in development efficiency.
- **Workflow Optimization**: Collaborated with cross-functional teams to identify bottlenecks, leading to a **40% reduction** in processing time for key workflows.
- **Intelligent Automation**: Integrated AI capabilities using UiPath's AI Center, allowing bots to make intelligent decisions and improving overall process accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- **UiPath Studio & Orchestrator**
- **AI Center**
- **Python & SQL**
- **RESTful APIs**

## Outcome

The solutions deployed not only streamlined operations but also ensured high security and robustness through protocols like auto-login for locked screen operations. This project demonstrated the power of combining traditional RPA with AI to achieve autonomous automation.
